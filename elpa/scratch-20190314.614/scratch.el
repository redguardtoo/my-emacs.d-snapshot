;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Scratch
;; =======
;;
;; Scratch is an extension to Emacs that enables one to create scratch
;; buffers that are in the same mode as the current buffer.  This is
;; notably useful when working on code in some language; you may grab
;; code into a scratch buffer, and, by virtue of this extension, do so
;; using the Emacs formatting rules for that language.
;;
;; Scratch is available from MELPA.
;;
;;
;; Usage
;; =====
;;
;; - `M-x scratch' Immediately create a scratch buffer with the same
;; major mode as the current bufferâ€™s.  If the region is active, copy
;; it to the scratch buffer.  If a scratch buffer already exists, pop
;; to it (and do nothing with the region).
;;
;; - `C-u M-x scratch' Prompts for a major mode to create a scratch
;; buffer with.
;;
;;
;; Binding
;; =======
;;
;; `C-c s' is a good mnemonic binding for scratch-el:
;;
;;
;; (define-key (current-global-map) "\C-cs" #'scratch)
;;
;;
;; Customization
;; =============
;;
;; If you want to customize the behavior of all scratch buffers, you
;; can place hooks in `scratch-create-buffer-hook'.
;;
;; For per-mode customizations, you can add a hook to the mode, and
;; check `scratch-buffer' inside it.  For example, to set a default
;; title on all `org-mode' scratch buffers, you could do:
;;
;;
;; (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
;;           (lambda ()
;;             (when scratch-buffer
;;               (save-excursion
;;                 (goto-char (point-min))
;;                 (insert "#+TITLE: Scratch\n\n")))))

;;   Initial version.

;; 2010-08-16 Ian Eure

;; 2012-08-30 Ian Eure
;;   Dump current region into new scratch buffer

;; 2017-05-23 Ian Eure
;;   Set up *sql* buffers so they know about the inferior process they
;;   were created from.
;;   Add mappings for additional inferior modes.
;;   Fix checkdoc & package-lint issues.
;;
;; 2019-03-13 Ian Eure (v1.3)
;;   Add `scratch-create-buffer-hook', which runs any time a new
;;   scratch buffer is created.
;;   Fix an issue where SQL scratch buffers weren't linked to the SQLi
;;   buffers they were created from.
;;   Fix byte-compilation warnings.
;;   Substantially refactor & update code.
