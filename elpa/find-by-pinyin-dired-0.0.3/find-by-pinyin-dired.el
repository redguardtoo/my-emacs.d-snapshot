;;; Commentary:

;; Place this file somewhere (say ~/.emacs/lisp), add below code into your .emacs:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/")
;; (require 'find-by-pinyin-dired)
;;
;; Then `M-x find-by-pinyin-dired' or `M-x find-by-pinyin-in-project-dired'.
;;
;;   - If `find-by-pinyin-no-punc-p' is `t': English punctuation is converted to
;;     Chinese punctuation.

;;   - If `find-by-pinyin-traditional-p' is `t': traditional Chinese characters are used
;;     instead of simplified Chinese characters.

;;   - If `find-by-pinyin-only-chinese-p' is `t': the resulting regular expression doesn't
;;     contain the English letter.

;;; Code:

(require 'find-lisp)
(require 'pinyinlib)

(defvar find-by-pinyin-project-root nil
  "The project root directory used by `find-by-pinyin-in-project-dired'.")

(defvar find-by-pinyin-no-punc-p nil
